Need to connect a new SQL Database to this backend, then work on different endpoints for what we wanna do. 
I think we can make it possible for the client to go in and manipulate photos etc on his own using admin properties.
Only need to make one kind of person able to log in - THE ADMINS.

I can create the controllers and middleware after connecting the sql database
